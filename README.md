# Car-Price-Prediction-Web-App
Car Price Prediction Web App

    Objective: Developed a web application to predict car prices based on user-provided details such as car brand, model, year, mileage, and other specifications.
    Technologies Used:
        Streamlit: Used Streamlit library in Python for building the web application interface.
        Selenium: Used Selenium for web scraping to collect car details from various websites.
        Pandas and NumPy: Utilized Pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical computations.
        Scikit-learn: Used Scikit-learn library for loading the pre-trained machine learning model for price prediction.
        Heroku: Deployed the web app on Heroku for online accessibility.
    Workflow:
        Created a streamlined user interface with Streamlit allowing users to input car details.
        Integrated Selenium for web scraping to collect additional data about car models and brands.
        Preprocessed the data and fed it into a pre-trained machine learning model (stored as a pickle file) to predict car prices.
        Displayed the predicted car price to the user on the web interface.
